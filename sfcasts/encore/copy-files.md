# Copying Files

Do a force refresh on the homepage. Ok, we've got some broken images. Inspect
that. Of course: this points to `/images/meteor-shower.jpg`.

Open this template: `article/homepage.html.twig`. There it is:

[[[ code('fa1a3ce0f4') ]]]

A normal `asset()` function pointing to `images/meteor-shower.jpg`.
That's broken because we moved our entire `images/` directory out of `public/`
and into `assets/`.

There's a nice side-effect of using a build system like Webpack: you don't need to
keep your CSS, JavaScript or assets in a public directory anymore! You put them
in `assets/`, organize them *however* you want, and the end-user will only ever see
the final, built version.

But unless you're building a single page application, you'll probably still have
some cases where you want to render a good, old-fashioned `img` tag. And because
this image is *not* being processed through Webpack, it's not being copied into
the final `build/` directory.

## Hello `copyFiles()`

To make life more joyful, Encore has a feature for *exactly* this situation. Open
up `webpack.config.js`. And, anywhere in here, say `.copyFiles()` and pass this
a configuration object:

[[[ code('a1a4c74683') ]]]

***TIP
If you're using Encore 1.0 or later, you'll also need to install `file-loader`. As soon
as you use `copyFiles()`, check your Encore terminal tab: it will have the exact
command you need to run.
***

Obviously... this function helps you copy files from one place to another. Neato!
But... how exactly do we use it? One of the nicest things about Encore is that
its *code* is *extremely* well-documented. Hold `Command` or `Ctrl` and click
`copyFiles()`. It jumps us *straight* to the `index.js` file of Encore... which
is almost *entirely* small methods with HUGE docs above them! This is a *great*
resource for finding out, not only *how* you can use a function, but what functions
and features are even available!

For `copyFiles()`, it can be as simple as:

> I want to copy everything from `assets/images` into my build directory.

Yea, that sounds about right. If we did that, we could *then* reference those images
from our `img` tags. Copy that config, go back to `webpack.config.js` and paste. Oh,
I have an extra set of curly braces:

[[[ code('c6da6536e5') ]]]

And because we just made a change to `webpack.config.js`, find your terminal,
press `Ctrl`+`C`, and re-run Encore. When that finishes... go check it out. In
the `public/build/` directory, there they are: `meteor-shower.jpg`, `space-ice.png`
and so on.

## Controlling the copy Destination

Um, but it *is* kind of lame that it just dropped them directly into `build/`,
I'd rather, for my *own* sanity, copy these into `build/images/`.

Let's see... go back to the docs. Here it is: you *can* give it a destination...
and this has a few *wildcards* in it, like `[path]`, `[name]` and `[ext]`.
Oh, but use this second one instead: it gives us built-in file versioning by including
a hash of the contents in the filename.

Back in our config, paste that:

[[[ code('b744845f0b') ]]]

Before we restart Encore, shouldn't we delete some of these old files... at least
to get them out of the way and clean things up? Nope! Well, *yes*, but it's already
happening. One *other* optional feature that we're using is called `cleanOutputBeforeBuild()`:

[[[ code('247e30958e') ]]]

This is responsible for emptying the `build/` directory each time we build.

Ok, go restart Encore: `Ctrl`+`C`, then:

```terminal
yarn watch
```

Let's go check it out! Beautiful! Everything *now* copies to `images/` *and* includes
a hash.

## Public Path to Versioned Copied Files: manifest.json

Oh, but... that's a problem. What path are we supposed to use for the `img` tag?
Should we put `build/images/meteor-shower.5c77...jpg`? No, because if we ever updated
that image, the hash would change and all our `img` tags would break. And because
they aren't being processed by Webpack, that failure would be the *worst* kind:
it would fail *silently*!

In the `build/` directory, there are *two* special JSON files generated by Encore.
The first - `entrypoints.json` - is awesome because the Twig helpers can use it
to generate all of the script and link tags for an entry. But there's *another*
file: `manifest.json`.

This is a big, simple, beautiful map that contains *every* file that Encore outputs.
It maps from the *original* filename to the *final* filename. For most files, because
we haven't activated versioning globally yet, the paths are the same. But check
out the images! It maps from `build/images/meteor-shower.jpg` to the *real*, versioned
path! If we could read this file, we could automagically get the correct hash!

When we installed WebpackEncoreBundle, the recipe added a `config/packages/assets.yaml`
file. Inside, oh! It has `json_manifest_path` set to the path to `manifest.json`:

[[[ code('b9513c014f') ]]]

The *significance* of this line is that *anytime* we use the `asset()` function
in Twig, it will take that path and *look* for it inside of `manifest.json`.
If it finds it, it will use the final, versioned path.

*This* means that if we want to point to `meteor-shower.jpg`, all *we* need to
do is use the `build/images/meteor-shower.jpg` path. Copy that, go to the homepage
template, and paste it here:

[[[ code('7f8e27d36d') ]]]

There are a few other images tags in this file. Search for `<img`. This is pointing
to an uploaded file, not a static file - so, that's good. Ah, but this one needs
to change: `build/images/alien-profile.png`:

[[[ code('3376234017') ]]]

And one more, add `build/` before `space-ice.png`:

[[[ code('d97aee4ec4') ]]]

Let's try it! Move over, refresh and... we got it! Inspect element: it's the final,
versioned filename. Let's update the *last* `img` tags - they're in `show.html.twig`.
Search for `img` tags again, then... `build/`, `build/` and `build/`:

[[[ code('9f14bf4d41') ]]]

`copyFiles()` is nice because it lets you keep *all* your frontend files in the
same directory... even if some need to be copied to the build directory. But
to sweeten the deal, you're rewarded with free asset versioning.

By the way, this function was added by [@Lyrkan](https://github.com/Lyrkan),
one of the core devs for Encore and... even though it's pretty simple, it's
an absolutely brilliant implementation that I haven't seen used anywhere else.
So, if you like it, give him a thanks on Symfony Slack or Twitter.

Next, let's create *multiple* entry points to support page-specific CSS and
JavaScript.
